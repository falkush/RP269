# RP269
Crypto system based on random matrices over Z/2Z.

# Why 269?

Because 2^269-1 = 13822297*68625988504811774259364670661552948915363901845035416371912463477873783063. It is the smallest exponent greater than 256 such that 2^n-1 is a small prime multiplied by a large prime. It is difficult to test whether a matrix is primitive or not (see pdf for definition) if there are more than two prime factors. The large prime factor is important for the asymmetric encryption because of the Pohligâ€“Hellman algorithm.

# Asymmetric Encryption

The Diffie-Hellman key exchange and Schnorr signature scheme have been implemented using powers of a primitive matrix. More precisely, A^k v_0 = m where k is the private key, v_0 := (1,0,0,...,0), and m is the public key. The matrix A^k can be recovered from m. The Diffie-Hellman key exchange is slow because powers of A^k need to be computed. Both creating and verifying signatures are fast once powers of A^k are preloaded, but this speed-up has not been implemented.

# Symmetric Encryption

A one-way function is defined using words in the free group generated by two primitive matrices. See pdf for more details.
